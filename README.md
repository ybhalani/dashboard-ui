Just to make sure the internet is working and you are able to access https://amock.io/
because we are making an API call to fetch the data, not defined JSON in app
 
The page will reload in background with updated changes if you make edits.
 
### `npm run test`
 
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
 
Now to create the build folder you have to run the below command which will create the build folder in main directory of app.
 
### `npm run build`
 
After running build command you will see the build folder created at the root level of project
go into the build folder

> **Note:** Since tests can be co-located alongside other files inside the App Router, we have placed those tests in `app/` to demonstrate this behavior (which is different than `pages/`). You can still place all tests in `__tests__` if you prefer.
